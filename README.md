# MyChatBot
**MyChatBot** is a full-stack web application that leverages the OpenAI API to provide an interactive chat experience. It features a responsive frontend, a Python-based backend, and a persistent chat history system that allows the AI to remember previous interactions.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time Interaction: Chat with OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model.
- Persistent History: Conversations are saved to a local JSON file, allowing the bot to remember your name and previous context even after a page refresh.
- Markdown Support: Responses are rendered using marked.js, supporting bold text, lists, and code blocks.
- Smart Code Blocks: Automated "Copy" buttons for code snippets generated by the AI.
- Responsive Design: A clean, modern UI with a gradient background and intuitive chat bubbles.

## 🧠 How It Works

**Conversation Context**
The backend logic in flask_app.py manages a "rolling window" of context. Every time you send a message:
- The app loads the last 10 exchanges from history/hist.json.
- These messages are sent to OpenAI as context.
- The new response is appended to the JSON file, ensuring the bot "remembers" you (e.g., remembering your name is Ömer).
